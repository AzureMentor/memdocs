Microsoft Endpoint Manager is an integrated solution for managing all of your devices. Microsoft brings together Configuration Manager and Intune into a single console called **Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center**. Create Microsoft Defender antivirus policies in the Microsoft Endpoint Manager console and deploy them to Configuration Manager collections.


## Prerequisites

- Access to the [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://endpoint.microsoft.com/).
- An E5 license for [Microsoft Defender ATP](/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/minimum-requirements#licensing-requirements).
- An environment that's [tenant attached with uploaded devices](device-sync-actions.md).
- A minimum of Configuration Manager version 2006 and the corresponding version of the console installed.
   - Upgrade the target devices to the latest version of the Configuration Manager client.
- At least one Configuration Manager collection that's [available for assigning Endpoint security policies](atp-onboard.md#bkmk_collections)

To support managing tamper protection your environment must additionally meet the [prerequisites for managing  tamper protection with Intune](/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-antivirus/prevent-changes-to-security-settings-with-tamper-protection#turn-tamper-protection-on-or-off-for-your-organization-using-intune) as detailed in the Windows documentation.
