# Update Windows device  
Update your device so that you can access your organization's internal apps and resources. This article is for devices that are enrolled or trying to enroll in Intune.   

Before updating your device, be sure to back it up so that you can restore it to its previous state if something goes wrong. 

## Check for Windows updates 

To manually check for the latest recommended updates:

1. Select **Start**. 
2. Open the **Settings** app. 
3. Select **Update & Security**  > **Windows Update**.
4. Select **Check for updates**. 

>[!Important]
> Support for Windows 10 Mobile and Windows Phone 8.1 has ended. If you're trying to enroll a device that runs Windows 10 Mobile or Windows Phone 8.1, enrollment will fail. Devices currently enrolled will stop syncing with Intune. We recommend moving to a Windows 10 device. Windows 10 has built-in security and device features that have a first class integration with Microsoft Intune.  

## Benefit of device updates  
Keeping your device up-to-date lets you access the newest features, and it also ensures that your device has the most secure version of its operating system. Microsoft and other major vendors generally recommend keeping both personal and corporate devices running on the newest versions of software available to you. 

## Troubleshooting  
See Microsoft support's [Troubleshoot problems updating Windows 10](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4089834/windows-10-troubleshoot-problems-updating) to learn how to resolve common problems with your Windows 10 update.
