## Device configuration

### Use NetMotion as a VPN connection type for Android Enterprise devices<!-- 7764263 -->
When you create a VPN profile, NetMotion is available as a VPN connection type (**Devices** > **Device configuration** > **Create profile** > **Android Enterprise Fully Managed, Dedicated, and Corporate-Owned Work Profile** or **Android Enterprise Work Profile** for platform > **VPN** for profile > **NetMotion** for connection type).

For more information on VPN profiles in Intune, see [Create VPN profiles to connect to VPN servers](../configuration/vpn-settings-configure.md).

Applies to:
- Android Enterprise Work Profile
- Android Enterprise Fully Managed, Dedicated, and Corporate-Owned Work Profile
 
### Required password type default setting is changing on Android Enterprise devices<!-- 8092655  -->
On Android Enterprise devices, you can create a device password profile that sets the **Required password type** (**Devices** > **Configuration profiles** > **Create profile** > **Android Enterprise** for platform > **Fully Managed, Dedicated, and Corporate-Owned Work Profile** > **Device restrictions** > **Device password**).

The **Required password type** setting default is changing from **Numeric** to **Device default**.

Existing profiles aren't impacted. New profiles will automatically use **Device default**. 

Most devices don't require a password when **Device default** is selected. If you want to require your users to set up a passcode on their devices, configure the **Required password type** setting to something more secure than **Device default**.

To see the settings you can restrict, go to [Android Enterprise device settings to allow or restrict features](../configuration/device-restrictions-android-for-work.md).

Applies to:
- Android Enterprise

### New lockout password settings on macOS devices<!-- 7780272  -->
New settings are available when you create a macOS password profile (**Devices** > **Configuration profiles** > **Create profile** > **macOS** for platform > **Device restrictions** for profile > **Password**):

- **Maximum allowed sign-in attempts**: The maximum number of times users can try to consecutively sign in before the device locks them out, from 2-11. Set this value to a higher number. Setting this value to `2` or `3` isn't recommended, as mistakes are common. Applies to all enrollment types.
- **Lockout duration**: Choose how long the lockout lasts, in minutes. During a device lockout, the sign-in screen is inactive, and users can't sign in. When the lockout durations ends, user can sign in again. To use this setting, configure the **Maximum allowed sign-in attempts** setting. Applies to macOS 10.10 and newer, and all enrollment types.

For the current password settings, see [macOS password device restrictions](../configuration/device-restrictions-macos.md#password).

Applies to:

The Company Portal app will store, as well as display, push notifications sent to your users' iOS/iPadOS devices from the Microsoft Endpoint Manager console. Users who have opted in to receive Company Portal push notifications will be able to view and manage the customized stored messages that you send to their devices in the **Notifications** tab of the Company Portal. For related information, see [Device ownership notifications](../apps/company-portal-app.md#device-ownership-notification).


<!-- vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv -->
## Monitor and troubleshoot

### Noncompliant policies report to troubleshoot devices in error or noncompliant<!-- 6471368  -->
There's a new operational report to help troubleshoot errors and conflicts for compliance policies targeting devices. The "Noncompliant policies" report will show the list of compliance policies and the number of devices in an error or noncompliant state.

Administrators can use this report to:

- Drill down in a policy to see the list of devices and users in a failed state.
- Drill down to see the list of settings and setting information causing a failure.
- Filter, sort, and search across all records in the report.
- Identify when issues are occurring, and streamline troubleshooting.

For more information on monitoring and reporting, see [Monitor device compliance policies](../protect/compliance-policy-monitor.md) and [Intune reports](../fundamentals/reports.md).

### Manage allowed or blocked hardware devices with endpoint security Attack surface reduction policy<!-- 7339038   -->
Weâ€™re adding two new settings to the *Device control* profile for the endpoint security Attack surface reduction policy. (**Endpoint security** > **Attack surface reduction** > **Create Policy** > **Platform** select *Windows 10 and later* > **Device control**).

The new settings:

- Allow matching hardware devices
- Block matching hardware devices

Both new settings will have values of *Yes*, *No*, and *Not configured*. If set to Yes, youâ€™ll be able to create a list of hardware devices that will be allowed or blocked for installation. 

### Account protection policy changes in Endpoint security<!--  7492116   --> 
Weâ€™re reworking the endpoint security Account protection policy to use the new APIs for Windows Hello for Business. The new APIs will result in a more consistent experience. The new API is *./Device/Vendor/MSFT/PassportForWork*, which includes more options that can help reduce conflicts.   This API replaces the use of  *./User/Vendor/MSFT/PassportForWork*.  (**Endpoint security** > **Account protection**)
 
After the change, only new policies you then create will use the new API. Your existing policies wonâ€™t be affected by this change and will continue to use the older API.

### Policy merge support for USB device IDâ€™s in Device control profiles for endpoint security Attack surface reduction policy<!-- 7339038   -->
Weâ€™re expanding support for *policy merge* of Windows Defender Antivirus exclusions to support USB device IDâ€™s. This support will be added to the *Device control* profile for the endpoint security Attack surface reduction policy. (**Endpoint security** > **Attack surface reduction** > **Create Policy** > *for Platform select Windows 10 and later* > **Device control**).

With policy merge, the device ID's that are listed as part of different Device control profiles will merge into a single list for each device or user. That list is based on the individual policies that apply to a specific user or device. This merge will help to prevent conflicts between profiles and policies, and existing policies that were in conflict will no longer be in conflict for the device ID lists. 

### Improvements to endpoint security Firewall rules<!-- 7732448   -->
We're making several changes to improve the experience of configuring firewall rules in the *Microsoft Defender Firewall rules* profile for endpoint security Firewall policy.  (**Endpoint security** > **Firewall** > **Create Policy** > platform - *Windows 10 or later* > **Microsoft Defender Firewall rules**)  

Improvements include:

- Improved layout in the UI, including section headers to organize the view.
- Increasing the character limit for the description field 
- Validation of IP address entries.
- Sorting of IP address lists.
- Option to *select all* when clearing entries from an IP address list.

### Use Microsoft Defender for Endpoint in compliance policies for iOS<!-- 7895451  -->
As a public preview, youâ€™ll soon be able to use Intune device compliance policy to onboard iOS devices to Microsoft Defender for Advanced Threat Protection. (**Devices** > **Compliance policies** > **Create Policy** > *for Platform select iOS/iPad OS*)
 
After you onboard your enrolled devices, your compliance polices for iOS will be able to use the *threat level* signals from Microsoft Defender. These are the same signals that you can use today for Android and Windows 10 devices. The Defender for iOS app is moving from public preview to generally availability by the end of the year.

### New co-management eligibility organizational report<!-- 7854306  -->
The **Co-management eligibility** report provides an eligibility evaluation for devices that can be co-managed. Co-management enables you to concurrently manage Windows 10 devices by using both Configuration Manager and Microsoft Intune. You'll be able to view a summary for this report in the [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) by selecting **Reports** > **Co-management eligibility**. For related report information, see [Intune reports](../fundamentals/reports.md).

### New co-management device workloads organizational report<!-- 7854306  -->
The **Co-management device workloads** report provides a report of devices that are currently co-managed. Co-management enables you to concurrently manage Windows 10 devices by using both Configuration Manager and Microsoft Intune. You'll be able to view a summary for this report in the [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) by selecting **Reports** > **Co-management device workloads**. For related report information, see [Intune reports](../fundamentals/reports.md).

### New Intune operational report to help troubleshoot configuration profile issues<!-- 6471222  -->
A new operational report will be available in public preview to help troubleshoot errors and conflicts for configuration profiles that have been targeted to devices. The **Assignment failures** report will show a list of configuration profiles for the tenant and the number of devices in a state of error or conflict. Using this information, you can drill down to a profile to see a list of devices and users in a failure state related to the profile. Additionally, you can drill down even further to view a list of settings and setting details related to the cause of the failure. You have the ability to filter, sort, and search across all of the records throughout the report. This report will be available in the [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) by selecting **Devices** > **Monitor** > **Assignment failures (preview)**.

## Security

### App protection policy support for Symantec Endpoint Security and Check Point Sandblast<!--  4452423, 4731168 -->

In October of 2019, Intune app protection policy added the capability to use data from some of our Microsoft Threat Defense partners (MTD partners). We are adding support for the following partners, to use an app protection policy to block, or selectively wipe the user's corporate data based on the health of a device:

- **Check Point Sandblast** on Android, iOS and iPadOS
- **Symantec Endpoint Security** on Android, iOS and iPadOS

For information about using app protection policy with MTD partners, see [Create Mobile Threat Defense app protection policy with Intune](../protect/mtd-app-protection-policy.md).

### Microsoft Defender ATP creates Endpoint Manager Security task with vulnerability details<!-- 5568193  -->
Threat and Vulnerability Management (TVM) in Microsoft Defender ATP discovers misconfigured security settings on devices. Administrators use this information to update vulnerable devices.

Soon, Microsoft Defender ATP can raise an Endpoint Manager Security task (**Endpoint Manager** > **Endpoint Security** > **Security tasks**) with the vulnerability details, and show the affected devices. IT administrators can accept the security task, and deploy the required configuration. 

For more information on security tasks, see [Use Intune to remediate vulnerabilities identified by Microsoft Defender ATP](../protect/atp-manage-vulnerabilities.md).

### Endpoint security Firewall policies for tenant attached devices <!--  7323417     -->
As a public preview, youâ€™ll soon be able to use Endpoint security in Intune to manage Firewall settings on your tenant attached devices. (**Endpoint security** > **Firewall** > **Create Policy** > **Windows 10 and Windows Server (configMgr)**.  Use of endpoint security policies from Intune with tenant attached devices requires you to first configure Configuration Manager tenant attach. For more information, see [Tenant attach](../protect/tenant-attach-intune.md) in the Intune documentation. 

### Tri-state options for settings are coming to Endpoint Security Antivirus Security Experience policy<!-- 8082161  -->
Weâ€™re adding a third state of configuration for settings in Endpoint security Antivirus Security Experience policies, where the platform (Windows or macOS) can support the additional option (**Endpoint security** > **Antivirus Security Experience**).

For example, where a setting currently offers **Not configured** and **Yes**, if supported by the platform, weâ€™ll be adding the option **No**.

### Updated version for the Edge security baseline<!-- 8230830   -->
We'll soon release a new version of the security baseline for *Microsoft Edge*. The updated baseline will align to Microsoft Edge version 85.  (**Endpoint security** > **Security baselines** > **Microsoft Edge baseline**).
