# Export Intune reports using Graph APIs

All reports that have been migrated to the Intune reporting infrastructure will be available for export from a single top-level export API. You must use the Microsoft Graph API to make the HTTP call. Microsoft Graph is a RESTful web API that enables you to access Microsoft Cloud service resources. 

> [!NOTE]
> For information about making REST API calls, including tools for interacting with Microsoft Graph, see [Use the Microsoft Graph API](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/use-the-api).

Microsoft Endpoint Manager will export reports based on the following Microsoft Graph API endpoint:

```http
https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/deviceManagement/reports/exportJobs
```
## Example devices report request and response

When making the request, you must provide a `reportName` parameter as part of the request body based on the report that you would like to export. Below is an example of an export request for the **Devices** report. You must use the POST HTTP method on your request. The POST method is used to create a new resource or perform an action.

### Request example

The below request contains the HTTP method used on the request to Microsoft Graph.

```http
{ 
    "reportName": "Devices", 
    "filter": "", 
    "select": [ 
        "DeviceName", 
        "managementAgent", 
        "ownerType", 
        "complianceState", 
        "OS", 
        "OSVersion", 
        "LastContact", 
        "UPN", 
        "DeviceId" 
    ]
} 
```
### Response example

Based on the above POST request, Graph returns a response message. The response message is the data that you requested or the result of the operation.

```http
{ 
    "@odata.context": "https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/$metadata#deviceManagement/reports/exportJobs/$entity", 
    "id": "Devices_05e62361-783b-4cec-b635-0aed0ecf14a3", 
    "reportName": "Devices", 
    "filter": "", 
    "select": [ 
        "DeviceName", 
        "managementAgent", 
        "ownerType", 
        "complianceState", 
        "OS", 
        "OSVersion", 
        "LastContact", 
        "UPN", 
        "DeviceId" 
    ], 
    "format": "csv", 
    "snapshotId": null, 
    "status": "notStarted", 
    "url": null, 
    "requestDateTime": "2020-08-19T03:43:32.1405758Z", 
    "expirationDateTime": "0001-01-01T00:00:00Z" 
} 
```
You can then use the `id` field to query the status of the export with a GET request: 

For example:
```https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/deviceManagement/reports/exportJobs('Devices_05e62361-783b-4cec-b635-0aed0ecf14a3') ```

You will need to continue calling this URL until you get a response with a `status: completed` attribute. It will look like the following example:

```http
{ 
    "@odata.context": "https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/$metadata#deviceManagement/reports/exportJobs/$entity", 
    "id": "Devices_05e62361-783b-4cec-b635-0aed0ecf14a3", 
    "reportName": "Devices", 
    "filter": "", 
    "select": [ 
        "DeviceName", 
        "managementAgent", 
        "ownerType", 
        "complianceState", 
        "OS", 
        "OSVersion", 
        "LastContact", 
        "UPN", 
        "DeviceId" 
    ], 
    "format": "csv", 
    "snapshotId": null, 
    "status": "completed", 
    "url": "https://amsua0702repexpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/cec055a4-97f0-4889-b790-dc7ad0d12c29/Devices_05e62361-783b-4cec-b635-0aed0ecf14a3.zip?sv=2019-02-02&sr=b&sig=%2BP%2B4gGiZf0YzlQRuAV5Ji9Beorg4nnOtP%2F7bbFGH7GY%3D&skoid=1db6df02-4c8b-4cb3-8394-7ac2390642f8&sktid=72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47&skt=2020-08-19T03%3A48%3A32Z&ske=2020-08-19T09%3A44%3A23Z&sks=b&skv=2019-02-02&se=2020-08-19T09%3A44%3A23Z&sp=r", 
    "requestDateTime": "2020-08-19T03:43:32.1405758Z", 
    "expirationDateTime": "2020-08-19T09:44:23.8540289Z" 
} 
```
You can then directly download the compressed CSV from the `url` field.  

## Report parameters

There are three main parameters you can submit in your request body to define the export request: 

- `reportName`: Required. This parameter is the name of the report you want to specify.  
- `filter`: Not required for most reports. 
- `select`: Not required. If you don't specify a `select` value you will receive a default set of columns, which for most reports is the entire dataset. 

## Available reports

The following table contains the possible values for the `reportName` parameter. These are the currently available reports for export.
